In the United States, one analysis of nationwide flight-level data published by the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) found that approximately 22.6% of U.S. domestic flights were delayed in 2025, indicating that delays affect a substantial portion of airline operations. This conclusion is based on aggregated BTS on-time performance data covering millions of scheduled flights across major U.S. airports and carriers.\n",

As a result, airline operations teams have limited ability to anticipate delays before they occur and communicate expected disruptions early. An AI/ML solution can address this gap by using historical flight and airport data to predict the likelihood of delays in advance, enabling better operational planning and earlier communication with passengers.</span>"
